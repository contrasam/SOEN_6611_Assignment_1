WEEKLY e-LETTER from SCIENCE NEWS
July 5, 2003

This week's articles focus on the detection of five-quark particles, the rise of dengue fever in the Americas, the first example of an animal navigating by moonlight polarity, the use of viruses, bacteria, and fungi to engineer new structures, and more. The cover story looks at how human ancestors settled into one ecosystem after another. Food for Thought ponders the anticholesterol benefits of soy greens. MathTrek puzzles over alphamagic squares.
